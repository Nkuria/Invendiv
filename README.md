## Objective
Develop a real-time sports betting and leaderboard system using Ruby on Rails for core backend APIs and Node.js for handling high-frequency real-time updates. The system should allow users to place bets, update odds dynamically, and maintain a live leaderboard of top bettors.

## Requirements

1. Backend Setup
# Ruby on Rails
 - Set up a Ruby on Rails application as the main backend.
 - Use PostgreSQL or another suitable relational database for storing user, betting, and game data.
 - Implement RESTful APIs for:
 - User registration and authentication (use Devise or a custom auth system).
 - Placing bets and retrieving user bet history.
# Node.js
 - Use Node.js (with TypeScript) to implement a WebSocket server for handling real-time events and communications.

2. Data Processing
In Node.js, implement logic to process large payloads of incoming game data via WebSocket connections.
Use a Redis-backed message broker (like BullMQ or Sidekiq) for processing betting odds updates asynchronously between Rails and Node.js.
Implement Rails models and services to persist processed game data and betting odds.

3. Betting System
# API Endpoints in Rails:
- Create endpoints for placing bets (POST /bets) and retrieving bet history (GET /users/:id/bets).
- Implement simple odds calculation using ActiveRecord models and background jobs for real-time updates.

4. Real-time Leaderboard
- Node.js will push leaderboard data via WebSocket to clients, fetching data from the Rails backend.
- Use Redis pub/sub to sync leaderboard changes between Node.js and Rails for instantaneous updates.

5. Performance Optimization
- Caching in Rails: Implement caching strategies (using Redis or Memcached) for:
- Frequently accessed leaderboard data.
- Current betting odds.
- Ensure Node.js can handle concurrent WebSocket connections using libraries like Socket.IO or ws.

6. Data Persistence
- Use Rails ActiveRecord for managing bets, users, and game data.
- Implement database transactions to ensure data consistency and integrity when updating balances and placing bets.
